# Project README

## Project Overview

Welcome to my front-end project! This project showcases my skills in developing interactive and responsive web applications. It includes a variety of components and features designed to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end development.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: All components are fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes dynamic components such as accordions, carousels, and modals.
- **State Management**: Demonstrates the use of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management.
- **Styling**: Utilizes modern CSS techniques and frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Material UI for styling.
- **API Integration**: Showcases integration with external APIs for data fetching and display.
- **Form Handling**: Includes components for form handling and validation.

### Interview Preparation

#### Likely Questions

Here are some questions that are commonly asked in famous mock exams and browser coding interviews:

1. **React Hooks**: Explain the difference between `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. How do they work?
2. **Responsive Design**: How do you ensure that your web application is responsive?
3. **State Management**: How do you manage state in a React application? Can you provide an example?
4. **Styling**: What are the advantages of using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS? How do you apply styles conditionally in React?
5. **API Integration**: How do you handle data fetching in React? Can you demonstrate with an example?
6. **Form Handling**: How do you handle form inputs and validation in a React application?

#### Browser Coding Challenges

1. **Building an Accordion**: Implement a simple accordion component that allows for both single and multi-selection modes.
2. **Creating a Carousel**: Develop a carousel component that cycles through a set of images.
3. **Modal Implementation**: Create a modal component that can be triggered by a button and closed by clicking outside the modal or on a close button.
4. **API Data Display**: Fetch data from a public API and display it in a list or table format.
5. **Form Validation**: Build a form with input validation that provides real-time feedback to the user.
